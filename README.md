# IntelliJ Copy Plugin

A simple IntelliJ IDEA plugin that makes it easier to copy code and text cleanly from the IDE.  
This is especially useful when working with **AI chat prompts** (e.g., GPT-5, ChatGPT, or other LLMs) where you want to quickly copy code snippets without extra formatting or distractions.
